<h1>How it works?</h1>

Using <a  href="https://github.com/sauc23/Vercel-Bare-Server">Vercel Bare Server</a> we can host the bare server to on a dynamic hoster (like vercel) then link our static proxy to that server. posh found out about this. (he gave me the basics but I made the frontend)
Its actually pretty simple to set up a frontend + backend using this method.

<h1>How to use it?</h1>

You can also use a bare server from any other proxy website by simpily finding the bare server file then uv config under bare section to the website.

For example https://mybareserver.com/bare/ add the extra slash at the end.

Reminder it IS ILLEGAL to use someone elses bare server without permission (create your own bare server using tomphttp).

<h1>How to Deploy your static website</h1>

You can use any static website provider or just use <a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy</a> to host it on your own computer with caddy you can set your own subdomain/domain.

To set your own domain set up caddy normally but for your dns a recond set it to your IPv4 address or your public ip address (my public ip works for me ive had previous problems with ipv4)
